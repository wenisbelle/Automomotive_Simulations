  This is a simulation of a half vehicle,
  assuming that the vehicle's left and right
  are exactly the same, with focus on the Vertical
  dynamics. The following figure represents
  how the model is build.

  The theory behind this simulation can be found in: Brake Design and Safety - Rudolf Limpert - 2ed



  ## How to Run ðŸš€  
  To get started, run the *varglobal* script, this
  will start all important variables to start
  the simulation. In the script there are comments
  to help you to modify each element as you need 
  in your simulation.

  After that, open the *Model_V3_vertical.slx*
  Simulink file and that's it, you will have the system
  like in the image below.

  The most important subsystem is the brake, you can see it in details in the image below.
