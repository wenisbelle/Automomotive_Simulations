  # Bicycle Model üìù

  This is a simulation of a half vehicle,
  using the bicycle model to analyse the lateral dynamics of the
  vehicle, assuming that the vehicle's left and right
  are exactly the same. The following figure represents
  how the model is build.

  The theory behind this simulation can be found in: Vehicle Dynamics - Theory and Application - Reza N. Jazar.



  ## How to Run üöÄ  
  To get started, run the *Bicycle.m* script, this
  will start all important variables to start
  the simulation. Modify the elements as you need for your simulation.

  After that, open the *Bicycle_Simulink.slx*
  Simulink file and that's it, you will have the system
  like in the image below.

  You can change the steer angle according to your goal.
